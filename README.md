This project is based on online food ordering and payment system. 
Languages and Libraries Used - Django (Python), HTML, CSS, JS, SQL

Introduction: 
    The index page of the website shows the menu of the Pinochio's Pizza and Subs. There is also a dropdown in the navbar which allows access to different categories of menu and makes navigation easier. Finally, there is a user login and registeration tab. In order to make online purchases, user will need to login and get some balance in their account.

After Login:
    The payment system is old school! The user will need to contact the administrator in order to get balance. Once the administrator is paid some amount, that amount will be added to user's account. Now the user is all set to make purchases and have a good experience with the website.

The Super Admin Contorl Area:
    There is a special contorl system for users with staff status.Once a staff user will log in, they will automatically get access to that area. A staff user can add balance for the users using their email address and can update and check order status.

Personal Touch:
    The users can delete the orders from their cart before payment. Also, the staff can update the status of order once the order is completed. This status can be checked by the user in the track menu.

Conclusion:
    This is a basic web application implementing all the required features as stated in the project guidlines.
